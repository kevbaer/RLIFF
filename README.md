# RLIFF

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RLIFF is to be my first package and help me out when I’m
feeling down!

## Installation

You can install the development version of RLIFF from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("kevbaer/RLIFF")
```

…Though I’m not quite sure why you would want to!

## Example

Look at this cool quote!

``` r
library(RLIFF)
HAMILTON()
#> Dying is Easy, Young Ma?n, Living is Harder.
```
