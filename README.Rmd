# RLIFF

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RLIFF is to be my first package and help me out when I'm feeling down!

## Installation

You can install the development version of RLIFF from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("kevbaer/RLIFF")
```

...Though I'm not quite sure why you would want to!

## Example

Look at this cool quote!
```{r example}
library(RLIFF)
HAMILTON()
```
